# Introduction
My dataset is all of the professional League of Legends games played in 2022. The original dataset has 12 rows for each game that was played, 10 rows for each player and 2 rows for each team summary. There are over 100 columns in the data frame, including columns about the pick and bans during the drafting phase, information about the total gold each player earned and the total gold, and others. 


The columns that I am interested in are '''side'''
